/*
1. Scenario: Test with a positive integer n. 
   Description: Pass a positive integer to the function Piles. The function should return an integer that is equal to the number of ways to partition n with parts in non-increasing order.

2. Scenario: Test with zero as input. 
   Description: Pass zero to the function Piles. The function should return 1 as there is only one way to partition zero.

3. Scenario: Test with negative integer as input. 
   Description: Pass a negative integer to the function Piles. As the function is not designed to handle negative integers, the behavior in this scenario is undefined.

4. Scenario: Test with a very large integer as input. 
   Description: Pass a very large integer to the function Piles. This scenario tests the performance and efficiency of the function.

5. Scenario: Test with a small integer as input. 
   Description: Pass a small integer to the function Piles. This scenario tests the basic functionality of the function.

6. Scenario: Test with a non-integer input. 
   Description: Pass a non-integer input to the function Piles. As the function is designed to handle integers, the behavior in this scenario is undefined. 

7. Scenario: Test with no input.
   Description: Call the function Piles without any argument. As the function expects an integer as an argument, this should result in an error. 

8. Scenario: Test with multiple integers as input.
   Description: Pass multiple integers to the function Piles. The function is designed to handle only one argument, so this should result in an error. 

9. Scenario: Test with maximum integer limit.
   Description: Pass the maximum integer limit that GoLang can handle to the function Piles. This scenario tests the highest possible limit of the function.

	// This is not applicable in Go, as the function signature defines one input argument of type int.

	// Scenario 8: Test with multiple integers as input.
	// This is not applicable in Go, as the function signature defines one input argument of type int.
