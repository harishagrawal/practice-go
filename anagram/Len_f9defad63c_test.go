/*
1. Test Scenario: Check the length of an empty MyRune instance. The expected result should be 0.

2. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing a single rune. The expected result should be 1.

3. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing multiple runes. The expected result should be equal to the number of runes.

4. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing a mix of upper-case, lower-case, and special character runes. The expected result should be equal to the total number of all types of runes.

5. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing white spaces. The expected result should include white spaces as individual runes.

6. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing unicode characters. The expected result should be equal to the total number of unicode characters.

7. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing numeric runes. The expected result should be equal to the number of numeric runes.

8. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance containing a large number of runes. This is to test the performance and efficiency of the Len function.

9. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance with runes that are being dynamically added or removed. The expected result should accurately represent the current number of runes in the instance.

10. Test Scenario: Check the length of a MyRune instance that is null or undefined. This is to test the robustness of the Len function against null or undefined inputs. The function should handle such cases gracefully.
