/*
1. Test if the function correctly paints the specified points on the image when the image points are within the boundaries and their initial value is 1.
2. Test if the function does not paint the specified points when their initial value is not 1.
3. Test if the function does not paint the specified points when they are out of the image boundaries.
4. Test if the function does not paint the specified points when the color is not valid.
5. Test if the function works correctly when pointI and pointJ are both 0.
6. Test if the function works correctly when pointI and pointJ are both at their maximum values.
7. Test if the function works correctly when pointI is at its maximum value and pointJ is at its minimum value.
8. Test if the function works correctly when pointI is at its minimum value and pointJ is at its maximum value.
9. Test if the function works correctly with a large image.
10. Test if the function works correctly with a small image.
11. Test if the function works correctly when the image is not a perfect square (number of rows is not equal to the number of columns).
12. Test if the function behaves as expected when the image is a single point.
13. Test if the function behaves as expected when the image is empty.
14. Test if the function behaves as expected when the color is 0.
15. Test if the function behaves as expected when the color is 1.
16. Test if the function behaves as expected when the color is a large number.
