/*
1. Test Scenario: When the input word is empty and fragments are also empty.
   Expected Result: The function should return 0 as there are no fragments to build the word.

2. Test Scenario: When the input word is not empty but fragments are empty.
   Expected Result: The function should return 0 as there are no fragments to build the word.

3. Test Scenario: When the input word is empty but fragments are not empty.
   Expected Result: The function should return 0 as there is no word to be built.

4. Test Scenario: When the input word and fragments both are not empty and the word can be built using the fragments.
   Expected Result: The function should return the length of the word.

5. Test Scenario: When the input word and fragments both are not empty and the word cannot be built using the fragments.
   Expected Result: The function should return 0 as the word cannot be built using the fragments.

6. Test Scenario: When the input word and fragments contain special characters or numbers.
   Expected Result: The function should handle these cases and return the appropriate length if the word can be built, else return 0.

7. Test Scenario: When the input word is not empty but fragments contain empty strings.
   Expected Result: The function should ignore empty strings and try to build the word with non-empty fragments.

8. Test Scenario: When the input word contains whitespace and fragments also contain whitespace.
   Expected Result: The function should handle these cases and return the appropriate length if the word can be built, else return 0.

9. Test Scenario: When the input word and fragments are very large.
   Expected Result: The function should handle these cases without causing any memory issues.

10. Test Scenario: When the input word contains repeating fragments.
    Expected Result: The function should correctly handle repeating fragments and return the appropriate length if the word can be built, else return 0.
