/*
1. Test with a Zero Input: The function should be tested with an input of 0. This will test the function's ability to handle the smallest possible input.

2. Test with a Maximum Input: The function should be tested with the maximum possible 64-bit unsigned integer value (18446744073709551615). This will test the function's ability to handle the largest possible input.

3. Test with a Random Positive Integer: The function should be tested with a random positive 64-bit unsigned integer. This will test the function's ability to handle general cases.

4. Test with a Prime Number: The function should be tested with a prime number. Since prime numbers have unique characteristics, this can help uncover potential issues.

5. Test with a Power of Two: The function should be tested with a number that is a power of two. This will test the function's ability to handle numbers with a single bit set.

6. Test with an Even Number: The function should be tested with an even number. This will test the function's ability to handle numbers with the least significant bit not set.

7. Test with an Odd Number: The function should be tested with an odd number. This will test the function's ability to handle numbers with the least significant bit set.

8. Test with a Number with Multiple Bits Set: The function should be tested with a number that has multiple bits set. This will test the function's ability to handle numbers with more than one bit set.

9. Test with a Number with Only One Bit Set: The function should be tested with a number that has only one bit set. This will test the function's ability to handle numbers with only one bit set.

10. Test with a Number with All Bits Set: The function should be tested with a number that has all its bits set. This will test the function's ability to handle numbers with all bits set.

11. Test with a Negative Number: Even though the function expects an unsigned 64-bit integer, it should be tested with a negative number to ensure it handles this unexpected input gracefully. It should either return an error or handle the negative number in a well-defined manner.

// As the function only accepts unsigned integers, negative input test is not meaningful and can be skipped
