/*
1. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a valid Go code snippet. The function should return a list of function names that are called the most.

2. Test the FunctionFrequency function with an empty Go code snippet. The function should return nil.

3. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that consists of only comments. The function should return nil.

4. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains syntax errors. The function should return nil.

5. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet with function calls in different scopes, such as inside other functions, inside loops, or in conditional statements. The function should correctly count the frequency of all function calls.

6. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains function calls to both built-in and user-defined functions. The function should correctly count the frequency of all function calls.

7. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains function calls with different levels of nesting, such as function calls inside function calls. The function should correctly count the frequency of all function calls.

8. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains function calls to methods on objects. The function should correctly count the frequency of all function calls.

9. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains function calls to methods in different packages. The function should correctly count the frequency of all function calls.

10. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains multiple calls to the same function. The function should correctly count the frequency of all function calls.

11. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains no function calls at all. The function should return nil. 

12. Test the FunctionFrequency function with a Go code snippet that contains function calls with the same name but different scopes. The function should correctly differentiate between them and count their frequencies separately.
