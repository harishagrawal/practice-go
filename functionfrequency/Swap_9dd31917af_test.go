/*
1. Scenario: Swapping two elements at valid indices within the CallList array.
   Description: In this scenario, we have a CallList array with multiple elements. We will swap two elements at valid indices and check if they have exchanged their positions correctly.

2. Scenario: Swapping an element with itself.
   Description: In this scenario, we will swap an element in the list with itself (i.e., i and j are the same). The CallList should remain the same after the operation.

3. Scenario: Swapping elements at the boundaries of the CallList.
   Description: In this scenario, we will swap the first and last element of the CallList. This will test the function's ability to handle boundary conditions.

4. Scenario: Attempting to swap elements at invalid indices.
   Description: In this scenario, we will attempt to swap elements at indices that are out of range of the CallList. This should result in an out of range error.

5. Scenario: Swapping elements in an empty CallList.
   Description: In this scenario, we will attempt to swap elements in an empty CallList. This should result in an out of range error.

6. Scenario: Swapping elements in a CallList with only one element.
   Description: In this scenario, we will attempt to swap elements in a CallList that only contains one element. This should result in an out of range error, as there is no second element to swap with.

7. Scenario: Swapping elements in a CallList with two elements.
   Description: In this scenario, we will swap the two elements in a CallList that only contains two elements. After the swap, the element that was at index 0 should now be at index 1, and vice versa.

8. Scenario: Swapping elements in a large CallList.
   Description: In this scenario, we will swap two elements in a large CallList. This will test the function's performance and efficiency.
